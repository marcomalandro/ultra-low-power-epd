# Ultra Low power Electronic Paper Display Project (EPD)

Author: [M. Maia](https://github.com/marcomalandro)

My fiance was using a notepad to keep track of her grocery list on her fridge. I joked that I should build her a more legitimate grocery list and so here we are.

The requirements:

- standalone unit on the fridge
- unit displays the grocery list (and perhaps a few other useful pieces of information like time, weather and a daily quote)

This means it has to last on battery at least 180 days, otherwise it would get annoying to change batteries or recharge the unit.

## Hardware

The driver and display are from [Waveshare Electronics](https://www.waveshare.com/):
